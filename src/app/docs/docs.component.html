        Reverse engineering the github api was perhaps the hardest part. Taking
        time to understand what was returned and in what format was critical.

        The css is wonky. I chose to get it close but not waste time on making
        it perfect.

        Tests are only the boiler plate that is included in angular component
        creation. The code has been corrected where they failed. Again, time was
        short.
